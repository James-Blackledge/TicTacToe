    "Noughts and Crosses is a game which involves two players, taking turns on marking positions on a 3x3 grid with either an 'X' or an 'O'. In order to win the game, a player must successfully place three of their markers in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal series. If no player is able to place their markers in a series of three, then the game is considered a draw."

The string argument of the *print()* function neatly outputs the board for noughts and crosses. The use of the list argument allows the program to update the board when a player  has placed their marker in a particualr position. For example, if the player on the 'X' team places their marker in the middle of the board (the 5<sup>th</sup> position), num[4] would equal 'X'; thus the 5<sup>th</sup> position will not contain '5', it will contain 'X'.\n",

For example, if the 'X' player has their marker in board positions 1, 4, and 7, the string mapped to 'X' will change from '000000000' to '100100100'.
