    "Noughts and Crosses is a game which involves two players, taking turns on marking positions on a 3x3 grid with either an 'X' or an 'O'. In order to win the game, a player must successfully place three of their markers in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal series. If no player is able to place their markers in a series of three, then the game is considered a draw."
